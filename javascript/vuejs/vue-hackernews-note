what is Vue.mixin?
what is Vue.filters?
application shows real-time event updates. am guessing some firebase app is hosted
    - how am I sure? where's the uri?
application -> gets request for certain url -> gets api responses -> change components' state, route to appropriate components -> render



app.js has:
    - createRouter, createStore, sync(router, store)
    - mixins, filters (rendering related?)
    - ability to create itself and supply it to client/server: createApp

router.js has:
    - ability to route requests to views: require('some view.js -> that has .vue associated')
    - path and component
    - getMatchedComponents()

components:
    - server side rendering caching. what server though?
