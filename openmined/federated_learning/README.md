### Federated Learning and Duet

- Duet removes centralized third-party that controls the learning process. Only data owner and data scientist exists.
- Duet also provides data owners granular control over their data (participation, operations permitted on data)
- Owner simply sets up a Duet connection
- Data scientists sets up a model and send that model over.
