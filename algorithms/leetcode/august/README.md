your responsibility is to:

compile a set of tricks, but those seem like a set of - things to remember and hone. you will think this is pointless, but countless examples of mental acuity has proven otherwise. there's always a better way, and the whole point of engineering is to find a better way. algorithms are confined to finding better solution for the problems we encounter but cannot mathematically, explicitly solve.

so coming to think about it, this is part of you.
